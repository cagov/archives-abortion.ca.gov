Here are some things to think about when planning an abortion.

## Travel or childcare

If you need to travel to get an abortion, there are organizations that can help you find a place to stay.

[ACCESS Reproductive Justice](https://accessrj.org/case-study/access-reproductive-justice-healthline/) may help you find and pay for:

- Lodging
- Transportation
- Meals
- Childcare

The [National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/) can also help you find a fund that will help with your travel costs.

If you have kids or other dependents, see if a friend can watch them during the procedure. Even if you’re using abortion pills, it can be helpful to have someone to help you that first day.

## Get help

The [ACCESS Reproductive Justice](https://accessrj.org/case-study/access-reproductive-justice-healthline/) hotline (<a href="tel:+1-800-376-4636">800-376-4636</a>) provides support for people who want to get care in California. They can answer questions and connect you to resources.

There are funds that support people with planning and paying for an abortion. The [National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/#funds) has a list sorted by state.

[Repro Legal Hotline](https://www.reprolegalhelpline.org/) (<a href="tel:+1-888-868-2812">844-868-2812</a>) can help answer any legal questions related to planning.
