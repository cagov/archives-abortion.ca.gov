`i18n-Everything.xls` is an excel file, considered the 'source of truth' for the pages/_data/i18n.js file

`pull_i18n_from_excel.py` may be used to convert the Excel spreadsheet (i18n-Everything.xls) to i18n.js format, after a translation pass by AvantPage. Its output is currently identical to the current pages/_data/i18n.js file.

`pull_i18n_from_airtable.py` was used to read the content of an Airtable containing table translations and put it into the format used by pages/data/i18n.js.

The Airtable table can be found here: https://airtable.com/appE96H4RoloCaBos/tblpQr44ltFH7ZJNx/viwpUoKQrWJVw8Byy?blocks=hide
