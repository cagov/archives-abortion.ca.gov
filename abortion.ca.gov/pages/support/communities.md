Some communities may have unique needs in accessing abortion care.

## People who live outside of California

If you live outside of California, you can get an abortion in California. There is no residency requirement for abortion in California. You can use the [California abortion finder](/find-a-provider/) to find a provider. Some groups provide [help with travel](/getting-an-abortion/planning/#travel-or-childcare) to get an abortion.

Your state may have laws about residents receiving abortion services in other states. You may want to review your [legal rights](/your-rights/your-legal-right-to-an-abortion/), including in your own state, before seeking care.

If you cannot travel to California to get an abortion, an [abortion fund](https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/) may be able to help you find a state thatâ€™s a better option for you.

## Immigrants and undocumented people

If you are undocumented, you have the right to an abortion in California.

Federal policies keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials away from health care facilities.

[Medi-Cal](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/pages/whatismedi-cal.aspx) covers abortion for California residents, regardless of immigration status. You may also be able to get Medi-Cal for other health care services. Find out how you can [apply for Medi-Cal](/getting-an-abortion/how-to-pay-for-an-abortion/#medi-cal).

## People with English as an additional language

All abortion providers in California must provide translation resources. Some providers also offer translation services.

- The [National Abortion Fund hotline](https://prochoice.org/patients/naf-hotline/) (<a href="tel:+1-800-772-9100">800-772-9100</a>) is available in Spanish. They can help you with information, consultation, and referrals to providers.
