There are two main abortion options: *medication abortion* and *in-clinic procedures*. Your options can vary based on your [pregnancy stage](/getting-an-abortion/about-abortion/#pregnancy-stages) and the provider you choose.

This [list of pros and cons](https://www.abortionfinder.org/abortion-types/pill-vs-procedure-how-to-decide) for each abortion type can help you decide what is best for you.

## Medication abortion

This option is also known as the *abortion pill*, though it actually requires you to take two pills. It is generally an option up to 10 or 11 weeks from the first day of your last period.

### How to get it

In California, you may be able to get your abortion medication by mail after a telehealth visit with a qualified provider. Otherwise, you will need to visit a clinic in person to get the medication.

- The [California abortion finder](/find-a-provider/) can help you find a telehealth or in-person provider.
- [PLAN C](https://www.plancpills.org/) provides information on how to access at-home abortion pill options online.
- [Aid Access](https://aidaccess.org/en/) supports all people with an unwanted pregnancy to access to abortion pills.

### How it works

A medication abortion is when you take two types of pills up to 48 hours apart. You can take the medication in a clinic, at home, or wherever you’re staying.

The medication stops your body’s production of pregnancy hormones. This causes your uterus to expel the pregnancy.

After taking both pills, most people expel the pregnancy in 4 to 5 hours. For others, the process can take longer.

## In-clinic procedures

Also known as a *surgical abortion*, this is a common medical procedure done in a clinic or hospital.

There are two main procedure options: *aspiration abortion* and *dilation and evacuation (D&E)*.

The kind of procedure you’ll need depends on your [pregnancy stage](/getting-an-abortion/about-abortion/#pregnancy-stages) and your medical needs and preferences.

### Aspiration abortion

This option is generally available up to 14 to 16 weeks from the first day of your last period.

Your provider uses gentle suction and sometimes a small medical tool to remove the pregnancy tissue from your uterus. The procedure usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes.

### Dilation and evacuation (D&E)

This option is generally used if it’s been more than 16 weeks since the first day of your last period.

Your provider will dilate your cervix and use small medical tools to remove the pregnancy tissue from your uterus. The procedure usually takes 10 to 20 minutes.
