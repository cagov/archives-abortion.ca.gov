An abortion is a procedure that ends a pregnancy. It is a very common and safe procedure when performed by a qualified health care provider.

If you are thinking about getting an abortion, you are not alone. Based on data from 2014, about 1 in 4 people in the US who can become pregnant will have an abortion by age 45. 60% of people who get an abortion already have kids.

## What is an abortion

An *abortion* is a medical treatment that ends a pregnancy. It can also be called a *termination of pregnancy*.

An abortion can involve taking pills or having a common medical procedure at a health clinic. The type of abortion you have can depend on your preference, any medical conditions you have, and your pregnancy stage.

## Pregnancy stages

A pregnancy is divided into three stages called *trimesters*.

- A trimester lasts between 12 and 14 weeks.
- The first trimester starts on the first day of your last period.

Timing is important when deciding to have an abortion.  The earlier your pregnancy stage, the more [types of abortion](/getting-an-abortion/types-of-abortion/) may be available to you.
