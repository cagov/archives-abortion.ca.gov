Emotional health or abortion support are important factors when considering an abortion.

## Help while having an abortion

You may want someone with you when you get an abortion or go to an appointment. Call your abortion provider to see if this is allowed. If others are not allowed in the room with you, they can still go with you and stay in the waiting room or outside.

You can also have an abortion doula who can support you. [ACCESS Reproductive Justice](https://accessrj.org/case-study/access-reproductive-justice-healthline/) can help connect you to a doula.
