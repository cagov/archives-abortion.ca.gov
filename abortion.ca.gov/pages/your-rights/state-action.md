After the U.S. Supreme Court’s _Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization_ decision, California acted swiftly to protect abortion rights and access.

## Protecting patients, providers, and supporters

- California voters passed [Proposition 1](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%201.1.&article=I), which explicitly enshrines in the state constitution the right to choose to have an abortion.
- Governor Newsom issued [Executive Order N-12-22](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/6.27.22-EO-N-12-22-Reproductive-Freedom.pdf?emrc=4e1397), which:
  - Prohibits state agencies from cooperating with out-of-state abortion actions such as preventing medical records, patient data and other information from being shared by state agencies in response to inquiries or investigations brought by other states or individuals within those states looking to restrict abortion care access; and
  - Adopts a policy of declining out-of-state extradition requests related to legal abortions in California.
- Several bills were enacted into law by the legislature and the governor:
  - [AB 1242](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1242) seeks to stop law enforcement and California corporations from cooperating with out-of-state entities regarding legal abortions in California.

  - [AB 2091](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2091) seeks to keep medical information about abortion private, even in response to an out-of-state subpoena or request.

- The Department of Health Care Services issued All Plan Letter (APL) [22-022](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/formsandpubs/Documents/MMCDAPLsandPolicyLetters/APL2022/APL22-022.pdf) reminding Medi-Cal Managed Care Health Plans that they must:
  - Cover abortion care without imposing access hurdles
  - Allow enrollees to go to any Medi-Cal provider for abortion care

- The Department of Justice created a new [consumer complaint form](https://oag.ca.gov/crisis-pregnancy-center-complaint) for Californians who have been the victim or target of deceptive, misleading, unfair, or unlawful conduct by fake clinics (aka crisis pregnancy centers).
